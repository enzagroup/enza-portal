    ## Overview
    
    Welcome to the Enza REST API Developer Portal. Our API provides seamless integration . This portal offers all the necessary tools, detailed documentation, and API endpoints required to empower your financial operations with real-time card issuance capabilities.
    
    Follow this guide to:
    - Understand API authentication and security requirements
    - Generate and configure the credentials required to access the Enza Developers API
    - Use the API endpoints to create cards and manage customer accounts
    - Learn best practices for integrating with our platform
    
    ---
    
    ## Step 1: Generate API Credentials
    
    ### API Key Authentication
    
    All API requests require an **API Key** for authentication. The API key must be included in the request header:
    
    ```
    x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    
    ### Development vs Production Keys
    
    - Both Development/UAT and Production API Keys will be shared securely through encrypted channels upon agreement and approval.
    
    ### Security Requirements
    
    ⚠️ **Important Security Measures:**
    
    1. **IP Whitelisting**: Your server IP addresses must be whitelisted before you can access the APIs
       - Contact our support team to whitelist your IPs
       - Provide both development and production IP addresses
    
    2. **Secure Key Storage**: Never expose your API keys in client-side code or public repositories
    
    3. **HTTPS Only**: All API requests must use HTTPS protocol

    ---
    
    ## Key Features
    
    - 💳 **Instant Card Issuance**: Issue physical and virtual cards in real-time
    - 🛠️ **Card Management**: Complete lifecycle management from creation to closure
    - 📊 **Transaction Monitoring**: Real-time transaction tracking and reporting
    - 🔐 **PIN Management**: Secure PIN operations for enhanced security
    - 🛍️ **E-Commerce Controls**: Manage online transaction capabilities
    
    ---
    
    ## Next Steps
    
    1. **Review Use Cases**: Explore the different API endpoints and understand the scenarios for each
    2. **Integration Testing**: Test your integration in the UAT environment
    3. **Request Production Access**: Contact our team when ready to go live
    4. **Monitor & Optimize**: Use our transaction APIs to monitor card usage and optimize your integration

      description: |
        Create a virtual prepaid card for an **existing customer only**.
        
        ## ⚠️ Important: Customer Must Exist First
        
        **This API only works for existing customers.** If the customer doesn't exist, you will receive an error.
        
        **Workflow:**
        
        1. **Check if Customer Exists** using `POST /customers/search`
           - Search by nationalId, passport, or identityId
           - If customer **does NOT exist** → Use `POST /customers/create` to create the customer first
           - If customer **exists** → Proceed to step 2
        
        2. **Create Prepaid Card** using this API (`POST /cards/create-prepaid`)
           - Provide the customer's document ID (nationalId, passport, or identityId)
           - Optionally enable auto-activation and notifications
        
        ---
        
        **Process Flow:**
        1. **Customer Verification**: Check if customer exists using document ID
        2. **Card Issuance**: Create issuing and financial contracts, issue virtual card
        3. **Card Activation** (Optional): Set `autoActivate: true` to automatically activate the card (default: false)
        4. **Notifications** (Optional): Set `notificationStatus: "enabled"` to enable SMS/Email notifications
        
        **Note:** By default, card is NOT automatically activated unless `autoActivate` is set to `true`

      description: |
        Create a debit card for an **existing customer only**.
        
        ## ⚠️ Important: Customer Must Exist First
        
        **This API only works for existing customers.** If the customer doesn't exist, you will receive an error.
        
        **Workflow:**
        
        1. **Check if Customer Exists** using `POST /customers/search`
           - Search by nationalId, passport, or identityId
           - If customer **does NOT exist** → Use `POST /customers/create` to create the customer first
           - If customer **exists** → Proceed to step 2
        
        2. **Create Debit Card** using this API (`POST /cards/create-debit`)
           - Provide the customer's ID (nationalId, passport, or identityId)
           - Provide the account number
           - Optionally enable notifications
           - Optionally activate the card
